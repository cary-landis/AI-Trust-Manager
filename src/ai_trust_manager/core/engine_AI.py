# PURPOSE: The purpose of engine_AI is to provide the AI risk scoring logic for the policy engine.
# AI SIMULATION: Until AI is integrated, the AI inference is simulated by returning a risk_score from the context if provided.
# HOW IT WORKS: The test scripts may pass risk_score as part of the context for testing. If risk_score is present, it is used as the AI result. Otherwise, a default value is returned.
#

# MODEL SELECTION: When integrating real AI, specify the model name, version, or endpoint here.
# Example: model_name = "openai-gpt-4" or model_endpoint = "https://api.example.com/model"
#
# TODO: Add logic to select and call the appropriate AI model for risk scoring.
